# RA-H BYO-Key Plan (Future Work)

The production repo remains private and powers the packaged Mac app. A separate, minimal open-source project will be created later for users who want to run RA-H with their own API keys. That future repo will include:

1. Basic three-panel UI
2. Local SQLite storage
3. Simple Settings → API Keys experience (no Supabase/subscription backend)

No active work is happening in this repo toward that goal right now. Track progress in `docs/development/prd-private-repo-reset.md`.
